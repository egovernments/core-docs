# 5.VPC

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated [private cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-a-private-cloud/) hosted within a [public cloud](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-a-public-cloud/). VPC customers can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but the private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider. (Not all private clouds are hosted in this fashion.) VPCs combine the scalability and convenience of public cloud computing with the data isolation of private cloud computing.
