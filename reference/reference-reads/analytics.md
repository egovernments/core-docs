# Analytics

DIGIT analytics enable -&#x20;

* administrators to view the dashboard based on which they can take day-to-day planning and operational decisions
* citizens to view and assess how the city administration is delivering services to them&#x20;
* employees to identify immediate areas of focus so that they can direct their efforts accordingly
* analysts and researchers to access data in a format that enables them to analyse data rapidly and provide deep insights

In order to enable the above in a scalable, secure and reliable manner, the DIGIT platform needs to ensure -

* transaction data is extracted, transformed and made available in an analytical datastore in a timely manner
* privacy issues are addressed as data is moved to the analytical data store
* as the transaction data structure is modified, the extract and transform programs continue to work seamlessly&#x20;
* users will have the ability to extend the transformation to suit their needs. Data may need to be transformed multiple times to address reporting and analytical requirements.&#x20;
* user can design and modify dashboards as per their requirements
* users can access data only based on their role
* raw as well as analytical datasets are made available through open data APIs for analysts and researchers
* anomalies detected are bubbled up to the right users at the right time
* users can perform descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics seamlessly&#x20;
* real-time scenarios e.g. IOT can be catered to by the platform.
