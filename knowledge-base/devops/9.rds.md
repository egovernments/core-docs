# 9.RDS

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed SQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon RDS supports an array of database engines to store and organize data. It also helps with relational database management tasks, such as data migration, backup, recovery and patching.

Amazon RDS facilitates the deployment and maintenance of relational databases in the cloud. A cloud administrator uses Amazon RDS to set up, operate, manage and scale a relational instance of a cloud database. Amazon RDS is not itself a database; it is a service used to manage relational databases.

Amazon provides several instance types with different combinations of resources, such as CPU, memory, storage options and networking capacity. Each type comes in a variety of sizes to suit the needs of different workloads.
