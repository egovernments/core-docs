# 8.Worker Node Group

Amazon EKS managed node groups automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of nodes (Amazon EC2 instances) for Amazon EKS Kubernetes clusters.

* Amazon EKS managed node groups create and manage Amazon EC2 instances for you.
* Every managed node is provisioned as part of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that's managed for you by Amazon EKS. Moreover, every resource including Amazon EC2 instances and Auto Scaling groups run within your AWS account.
* The Auto Scaling group of a managed node group spans every subnet that you specify when you create the group.
* Amazon EKS tags managed node group resources so that they are configured to use the Kubernetes [Cluster Autoscaler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/autoscaling.html#cluster-autoscaler).
