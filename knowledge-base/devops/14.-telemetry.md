# 14. Telemetry

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a collection of tools, **APIs**, and **SDKs**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*opvCYIil8JKsovfpDJ1-\_Q.png)

1. **Instrument** the application using OpenTelemetry SDK.
2. Traces are sent to a (collector) **agent**.
3. The collector **exposes** ports **4317**(gRPC) and/or **4318**(http) using **OTLP.**
4. Traces are then **exported** (in this case to [**Jaeger**](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)) and stores the traces on the **backend**
5. The **Jaeger Query** retrieves the traces and expose them to the Jaeger UI.
6. **Jaeger UI** provides a web based user interface that can be used to analyse traces.
7. The **storage backend** can be [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/\_/index.html), [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), a vendor ([Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/), [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com/), [Signoz](https://signoz.io/), [Logz.io](https://logz.io/), [Aspecto](https://www.aspecto.io/) etc..).

## What is OpenTelemetry? <a href="#506e" id="506e"></a>

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) gives us the tools to create trace data. It provides a **vendor agnostic** standard for **observability** as it aims to **standardise** the generation of traces.

This is good, because that means that we are not tied to any tool (or vendor). Not only can we use **any programming language** we want, but we can also pick and choose the **storage** backend, thus avoiding a potential buy in from commercial vendors.

> It also means that _developers can instrument their application without having to know where the data will be stored._

## OpenTelemetry API <a href="#8d11" id="8d11"></a>

Defines how OpenTelemetry is used.

## OpenTelemetry SDK <a href="#3ce5" id="3ce5"></a>

Defines the specific implementation of the API for a language.

## Instrumentation <a href="#d4a6" id="d4a6"></a>

As you can see from the image (at the top), in order to get trace data, we first need to **instrument** the application. To collect the trace data, we can use the **OpenTelemetry SDK.**

The trace data can be generated using either **automatic** or **manual (**or a mix**)** instrumentation.

To instrument your application with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), go to the OpenTelemetry [repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry), and pick the language for your application and follow the instructions.

### Auto Instrumentation <a href="#2019" id="2019"></a>

_One of the best ways to instrument applications is to use OpenTelemetry automatic instrumentation (auto-instrumentation). This approach is simple, easy, and doesn’t require many code changes._

Using auto-instrumentation libraries, means that you **don’t need to** write code for the trace information to be collected. ​ ​In fact, OpenTelemetry offers an API and SDK that allows for easy `bootstrapping` of distributed tracing into your software.

> This is good to know if don’t have the necessary knowledge (or time) to create a tracing framework tailored for your application.

On [OpenTelemetry Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/registry/) you can search for libraries, plugins, integrations, and other useful tools for extending OpenTelemetry.

For example, running the following command will automatically instrument your python code.

`opentelemetry-instrument python app.py`

When you use auto instrumentation, a predefined sets off spans will be created for you and populated with relevant attributes.

### Manual Instrumentation <a href="#1e25" id="1e25"></a>

Manual instrumentation is when you write specific code for your application. _It’s the process of adding observability code to your application._ This can more effectively suit your needs. For example, you can add attributes and events.

Once you have collected trace data, you need to **send** it somewhere.

## OpenTelemetry Protocol <a href="#f670" id="f670"></a>

_OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) specification describes the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources, intermediate nodes such as collectors and telemetry backends._ [source](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md)

The OTLP protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. The OpenTelemetry SDK then transforms events into OTLP data.

## OpenTelemetry Collector <a href="#625f" id="625f"></a>

The data from your instrumented application can be sent to an [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) collector.

The collector is a component of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that **collects** trace data (spans, metrics, logs etc) **process** (pre-processes data), and **exports** the data (sends it off to a backend that you want to talk to).

The [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) **collector** can receive telemetry data in **multiple formats**.

## How to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector <a href="#1199" id="1199"></a>

### Agent vs Gateway <a href="#08cb" id="08cb"></a>

The **collector** can be setup as an **agent** or as a **gateway**.

We usually first send traces to a (collector) **agent**. This (collector) agent handles the trace data from the instrumented application.

The (collector) agent can **offload responsibilities** that the client instrumentation otherwise need to handle. This includes **batching**, **retry**, **encryption**, **compression** and more.

> You can also perform **sampling** here depending on the amount of traces/traffic you want to send. (_ie. take only 10% of the traces_).

You need to configure **receivers** (_how data gets into the collector_), which then **transform** the data (**process)** before sending it to one or more backends using **exporters.**

### Receivers <a href="#6477" id="6477"></a>

Here we configure a **receiver** (on the collector) that accepts OTLP data on port **4317** (gRPC). (You also need to configure your application to export over OTLP to use it)

```
otlp:        protocols:          grpc:            endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4317"
```

### Exporters <a href="#5138" id="5138"></a>

Once you’ve instrumented your code, you need to get the data out in order to do anything useful with it. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) comes with a variety of **exporters**.

The exporters **converts** OpenTelemetry protocol (**OTLP**) formatted data to their respective predefined back-end format and exports this data to be interpreted by the back-end or system.

For example, for metrics, there is a [Prometheus](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/exporters/#prometheus) exporter that allows sending metrics so that Prometheus can consume it.

A common scenario (especially during testing), is to export all data directly to [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) using the **jaeger-exporter**.

You can read more about exporters [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/exporters/)

### Storage Backends <a href="#25b5" id="25b5"></a>

> _It’s important to know that the OpenTelemetry collector does not provides their own backend._

The **storage backend** can be [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/\_/index.html), [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), a vendor ([Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/), [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com/), [Signoz](https://signoz.io/), [Logz.io](https://logz.io/), [Aspecto](https://www.aspecto.io/) etc..).
