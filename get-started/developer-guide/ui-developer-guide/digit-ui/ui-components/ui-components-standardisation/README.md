# UI Components Standardisation

## Introduction <a href="#dlzdc5xdz5ch" id="dlzdc5xdz5ch"></a>

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive approach to enhancing a UI library to reduce UI/UX audit bugs after development. The improvements include the integration of newer components, standardisation of design principles, stability enhancements, conversion of px to em units for scalability and accessibility, the introduction of Storybook for component checking, implementation of colour and text size constants, addition of newer component variants, and creation of Flutter widgets for cross-platform compatibility.

### Integrate New Components <a href="#id-3aqkabis4f9a" id="id-3aqkabis4f9a"></a>

To address UI/UX audit bugs, we will integrate newer components that offer improved functionality, design, and performance. These components should align with current design trends and user expectations to enhance the overall user experience.\

### Standardise Design Principles <a href="#ads3u4tuhemc" id="ads3u4tuhemc"></a>

Standardising design principles ensures consistency across the UI library, reducing the likelihood of UI/UX audit bugs. This involves establishing design guidelines, naming conventions, and component usage patterns.

### Enhance Stability  <a href="#axrg4lhtt9hj" id="axrg4lhtt9hj"></a>

Enhancing the stability of the UI library is crucial for reducing UI/UX audit bugs. This includes optimizing code quality, implementing robust testing strategies, and monitoring performance to identify and address potential issues.

### Convert px To em Units <a href="#tfi9ikybdhq4" id="tfi9ikybdhq4"></a>

Transitioning from px to em units improves scalability and accessibility, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to inconsistent text sizes and layouts across different devices and screen resolutions.

### Integrate With Storybook <a href="#mg554ko71sbr" id="mg554ko71sbr"></a>

Storybook provides a development environment for testing and documenting components, helping to identify and address UI/UX audit bugs early in the development process.

### Implement Color & Text Size Constants <a href="#n19lwfyl25ke" id="n19lwfyl25ke"></a>

Implementing colour and text size constants ensures consistency in styling across the UI library, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to colour contrast, readability, and visual hierarchy.

### Add New Component Variants <a href="#id-20groophu08q" id="id-20groophu08q"></a>

Introducing newer component variants enhances flexibility and caters to diverse user requirements, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to limited functionality or options.

### Create Flutter Widgets <a href="#naxi948y7b02" id="naxi948y7b02"></a>

Creating Flutter widgets extends the UI library's reach to mobile platforms, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to inconsistent user experiences across different devices and operating systems.

## Conclusion <a href="#id-1t75ngdm8hzh" id="id-1t75ngdm8hzh"></a>

By implementing these improvements, including integrating newer components, standardizing design principles, enhancing stability, converting px to em units, integrating with Storybook, introducing colour and text size constants, adding newer component variants, and creating Flutter widgets, the UI library will be better equipped to reduce UI/UX audit bugs after development. These enhancements promote consistency, scalability, accessibility, and cross-platform compatibility, resulting in a more polished and user-friendly experience for end-users.
