# Git Client installation

* GitHub is an open source tool which helps the developers to manage, store, track and control changes in their code. If we want to clone(copy) the data from GItHub we need to install Git.
* There are some alternatives for GitHub like GitLab, Bitbucket. But many developers prefer GitHub because it's more popular and they are used to the navigation. So we are using Git in **DIGIT**
* GitHub is used to create Individual projects.

### Checking for Git:

To check whether Git is already installed in your systems, open in terminal.
