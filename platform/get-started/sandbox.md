# Sandbox

The Sandbox environment allows users to develop a DIGIT service fast. The DIGIT core services are already set up in the sandbox environment.&#x20;

To access the DIGIT services you need an API Key and Secret. We are working on a self-service portal where you can register and get the keys. In the meantime, you can send an email to partner@egov.org.in to get the API access keys.

Once you get the API access keys, follow the step-by-step[ Developer Guide](../../get-started/developer-guide/backend-developer-guide/) to build a new DIGIT service.
