# Infrastructure Architecture

Various infrastructure resources required for DIGIT deployment can be provisioned from the AWS cloud manually. However, the best practice is to maintain consistency, automation, audit, reusability, and cost forecast. The use of infra-as-code using tools like [terraform](https://medium.com/tech-guides/terraform-zero-to-hero-733f6860bb9a) templates works well to this end.
