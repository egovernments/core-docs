# Data Protection & Privacy

## Objectives

Governments have to raise revenues, create and manage public goods, deliver public services, and provide social welfare. Each function requires multiple offices and officials, working at multiple levels (national, subnational, and local), that must follow multiple processes and coordinate with each other, as well as with private entities and individuals.

Local government bodies are mandated to provide for functions such as urban planning, regulation of land use and construction of buildings, roads, and bridges; the provision of water; public health; and sanitation and solid waste management. Municipal government operations include over two dozen areas, ranging from grievances, local taxes and fees, water and sewage connections, and records keeping (births, deaths, marriages, etc.).&#x20;

Most of these functions can be efficiently carried on through digital tools. eGovâ€™s DIGIT platform enables government entities to build their capacity, reduce administrative burdens, and improve governance through faster, more reliable, and more efficient delivery of services to citizens.

When implementing and using digital tools such as DIGIT, government entities and their contractors are likely to collect, store, process, use, and share data, including personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals.&#x20;

This section provides an understanding of the rules and good practices for data protection and privacy, guidelines for implementing these rules and good practices, and templates/draft documents that can be used as part of such data privacy and protection processes.

With the recent introduction of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023, it has become a legal mandate for governments to protect the personal data of citizens and provide them with a right to privacy.&#x20;
