# üîê Data Protection & Privacy

## Objectives

Governments raise revenues, create and manage public goods, deliver public services, and provide social welfare. Each function involves multiple offices and officials operating at various levels, national, subnational, and local. The entities have to follow multiple processes while coordinating with each other and with other stakeholders and individuals.

Local government bodies are obligated to fulfil crucial responsibilities, including urban planning, regulation of land use, and overseeing the construction of buildings, roads, and bridges. Additionally, they are tasked with providing essential services such as water supply, public health, sanitation, and solid waste management. Municipal government operations encompass a broad spectrum of functions, spanning more than two dozen areas. These include handling grievances, managing local taxes and fees, facilitating water and sewage connections, and maintaining records related to vital events such as births, deaths, marriages, and more.

Many of these functions can be optimally carried out using digital tools. eGov's DIGIT platform empowers government entities to enhance their capabilities, alleviate administrative burdens, and elevate governance by providing faster, more reliable, and efficient services to citizens.

In the process of implementing and utilizing digital tools like DIGIT, government entities and their contractors are prone to collecting, storing, processing, utilizing, and sharing data. This may include personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals.
