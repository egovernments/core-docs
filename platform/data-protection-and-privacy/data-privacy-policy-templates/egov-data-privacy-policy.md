## **1. About eGov** <a href="#_6h8j6em6wnmt" id="_6h8j6em6wnmt"></a>

eGov Foundation is a philanthropic mission that cares deeply about making the lives of ordinary citizens better, including health, sanitation, public finance management systems, and access and delivery of services from the government, by creating [open digital infrastructure and ecosystems](https://egov.org.in).

## **2. About DIGIT** <a href="#_gcg1rj311n9a" id="_gcg1rj311n9a"></a>

Digital Infrastructure for Governance, Impact & Transformation (DIGIT) is an open-source platform created by eGov **(**[<mark style="color:blue;">**platform owner**</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]**)**. It helps governments collect revenues, deliver services, and manage operations and workflows in an efficient, reliable, and transparent manner.

The DIGIT platform is built and designed to:

* Improve the delivery of services for citizens, making such services more accessible, inclusive, and easy to use
* Simplify the work of frontline workers, through streamlined workflows and easy-to-use interfaces
* Enable government employees to transition daily routine and repeatable work items from manual to digital systems, driving efficiency in public service delivery
* Provide tools to improve local government revenue mobilisation, through dashboards, systemized demand generation, and collection of taxes, user charges, fees, licences etc.
* Empower government administrators / [<mark style="color:blue;">**administering agencies**</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] to access relevant data for timely decision-making and action.

For a full list of products/services available on DIGIT, see [here](https://urban.digit.org/products/modules).

## **3. DIGIT Platform, DIGIT Implementations & Data** <a href="#_h663ey982ius" id="_h663ey982ius"></a>

As an open-source platform, DIGIT in & of itself does not collect, store, use, process, or share data.

DIGIT is deployed by national, state, or local government bodies. Such deployment may be done by in-house teams of the government, third-party service providers, or – in a small number of cases – by eGov.

Where eGov is participating in a deployment, whether as an implementing agency or supporting agency, this is on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) or agreement with the relevant government entity.

eGov is compliant with the relevant laws and regulations of India.\[4]

When the DIGIT platform is implemented in a particular place, that particular implementation will collect, store, use, process, and share data relevant to the specific purposes for which it is being used (i.e. the services it is enabling the local government or other service providers to provide). The party that is given the authority to implement DIGIT at a government entity level is called the **implementing agency.** Each implementation is carried out at a **program** level by **program owners**. The administering authority defines what the scope of a program can be**\[5]**.

All data collected, stored, used, processed, or shared by a DIGIT implementation is the property of the individuals to whom it pertains. The administering authority that is responsible for the implementation is also responsible for the management of this data.

This data is not, under any circumstances, the property of the implementing agency or the supporting agency.

## **4. What Data Does DIGIT Handle?** <a href="#_pb49o1fo5l06" id="_pb49o1fo5l06"></a>

A DIGIT implementation/ program collects and processes **personal data**\[6] such as the first name, last name, parent’s / guardian’s name, address, email address, telephone number, age, gender, and identification documents. It may collect your educational, demographic, location, device and other similar information.

The DIGIT implementation may also collect information such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain name, browser type, Operating System, Date and Time of the visit, pages visited, IMEI/IMSI number, device ID, location information, language settings, handset make & model etc.

A DIGIT implementation may derive, store, process, and share transactional data, which describes the progress of any ongoing task (e.g. any service requested by a resident) through the systems of the local government or other government agency. This can include information about the specific role to whom a given task is assigned (or with whom it is pending), the amount of time elapsed on processing / completing a given request (or task / sub-part thereof), and whether this task has been completed within the benchmark or designated amount of time. It can also include details about the channel through which a particular request was received, such as ULB counter, service centre, website, helpline, mobile app, chatbot, etc.

A DIGIT implementation can derive, store, process, and share aggregated data. These aggregates are derived from the transactional data. This includes data such as aggregate or cumulative revenue collection, aggregate or cumulative number of service requests, percentage of requests resolved within the benchmark time period, etc. The above data may be further analysed and presented in terms of the type of collection, request, or complaint, the channel through which it was received, etc.

A DIGIT implementation can also collect, store, process, and share telemetry data, which studies how much time is spent on a given screen or field in a workflow/user interface (UI). Such data is normally processed and shared in aggregate, and will not be used to identify specific individuals. In the event that specific individuals are sought to be identified, such as for user research, their consent will be sought for the further processing or sharing of their data.

## **5. Who Handles Data On DIGIT?** <a href="#_v5qhs66gtp8k" id="_v5qhs66gtp8k"></a>

* Administering authorities and Program Owners - State or Central government, government department employees and third-party contractors or agents( hired by governments): interact with the citizens, provide services, collect payments, and collect feedback, view real-time or compiled/aggregated data on city operations, which can inform performance management and policy-making.
* Implementing agencies and Supporting agencies: implement, customise, and maintain and support a DIGIT implementation.
* eGov employees, contractors, and consultants - when eGov is appointed as an implementing agency for implementing DIGIT in a few States, otherwise for support and maintenance.
* eGov may access, use, and share any data made public by government entity/ies, including in combination with aggregate and/or derived data as described below.
