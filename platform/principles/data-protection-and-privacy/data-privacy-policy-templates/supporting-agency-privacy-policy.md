We only access, store, process, use, or share any information/data (“data”) to assist the program owner/implementation agency. None of the above takes place without a written authorization agreement with the program owner/administering authority.

Data includes PII such as your first name, last name, parent’s / guardian’s name, address, email address, telephone number, age, gender, and identification documents. We may collect your educational, demographic, location, device and other similar information. The nature of the data would change as per the needs of the service providers/ULB/State or Central Government. We do not define the scope of the datasets, the Service Providers do.

We do not collect any data directly from you. We only access, process, use, store, and share datasets given to us by the Administering authority/Program owner/Service providers/Implementing Agencies.

We access data that is required to provide for the functional working, upkeep, troubleshooting and/or any functional support required by the program owner or administering authority .

We process data as a byproduct of the work we undertake for the program owner or administering authority.

We may store and share data that is required to execute the responsibilities given to us. Such storage will be temporary till the period of our work ends. Such sharing shall be restricted to internal teams, for third-party sharing of data, we would have authorizations in place by administering authorities or the program owners.

We also access, store, process, and share information pertaining to employees of our own as well as local government or other government agencies. Specific information can include name, age, gender, details of spouse or dependents, address, administrative details such as employee ID or other reference number, as well as information on bank accounts (used for processing salaries or pensions).

We also access, store, process, and share transactional data, which describes the progress of any ongoing task (e.g. any service requested by a resident) through the systems of the local government or other government agency. This can include information about the specific role to whom a given task is assigned (or with whom it is pending), the amount of time elapsed on processing / completing a given request (or task / sub-part thereof), and whether this task has been completed within the benchmark or designated amount of time. It can also include details about the channel through which a particular request was received, such as the ULB counter, service centre, website, helpline, mobile app, chatbot, etc.

We derive, store, process, and share aggregated data. These aggregates are derived from the transactional data. This includes data such as aggregate or cumulative revenue collection, aggregate or cumulative number of service requests, percentage of requests resolved within the benchmark time period, etc. The above data may be further analysed and presented in terms of the type of collection, request, or complaint, the channel through which it was received, etc.

We may collect, store, process, and share telemetry data, which studies how much time is spent on a given screen or field in a workflow/user interface (UI). Such data is normally processed and shared in aggregate, and will not be used to identify specific individuals. In the event that specific individuals are sought to be identified, such as for user research, their consent will be sought for the further processing or sharing of their data.

### **4. HOW DO WE ACCESS THIS DATA?** <a href="#id-5h321vhbm79i" id="id-5h321vhbm79i"></a>

## **Data Security Measures** <a href="#jlsxwfltrv40" id="jlsxwfltrv40"></a>

With respect to the data that we access, we adopt the following safeguards:

* Define roles for our employees, and only grant access to such data as is needed for them to perform their roles
* Maintain logs of access to the program’s systems by these roles, and enable the program owner / administrative agency or other authorised agencies to audit these access logs periodically
