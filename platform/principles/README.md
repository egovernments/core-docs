# Principles

1.

    The DIGIT platform design is based on the following key principles:

    1. **Single Source of Truth** - Shared data registries ensure data is updated and reused without duplicating transactional data. DIGIT registries offer standard API access that multiple service providers can leverage.
    2. **Security and Privacy** - DIGIT is designed to be secure by default featuring configurable role-based access. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is encrypted and inaccessible by analytical systems.&#x20;
    3. **Scalability -** DIGIT is built for scale. Its event-driven asynchronous microservices architecture enables DIGIT to handle millions of service requests with ease.
    4. **Flexible** - DIGIT adopts a multi-user approach. Users (agencies or service providers) have the provision to configure their master data and workflows. They also have the flexibility to develop and implement custom service versions.
    5. &#x20;**Modular** - DIGIT components are designed as modular microservices with interoperable APIs. Each service can be scaled, updated and deployed autonomously independent of others.&#x20;
    6. **Interoperable** - API first design and use of Open Standards wherever possible ensures DIGIT is interoperable with other systems. Data can be exchanged seamlessly as and when required.
    7. **Ease of Access** - DIGIT enables easy access to all stakeholders including citizens, employees, administrators, developers or system administrators. Data available through API can be routed to specific applications on the web, mobile, or chat.
    8. **Open** - DIGIT is open source and uses open source technologies and standards to ensure that data and core services are never vendor locked-in. MIT License gives rights to any agency or its partners to copy the source code and deploy it for their needs.
