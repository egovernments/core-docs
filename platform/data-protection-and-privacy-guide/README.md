# Data Protection & Privacy Guide

This section provides information on [data privacy and protection](introduction-to-data-privacy-and-protection-guidelines.md) from an eGov Foundation perspective. eGov undertook a qualitative study on the [global best practices for data protection and privacy](global-best-practices-for-data-protection-and-privacy.md).  As a result, we authored guidelines that can be followed by [platform owners](data-privacy-and-protection-for-platform-owners-and-providers.md) like eGov and by [partners who adopt DIGIT](data-privacy-and-protection-for-administration-authorities.md) (like governments or implementing partners).&#x20;

We have also added an eGov-specific privacy policy below. A sample privacy policy is also provided for governments or any partner who intends to adopt the DIGIT platform.
