## Common definitions

#### What is data?

Data is the information collected from an individual or about an individual. In DIGIT, data can be any information pertaining to a citizen, which is required for delivery of service and/or information exchange flow amongst citizen, employee, vendor and administrator. Data and information are interchangeably used.

#### What is data security?

Data security is the act of securing and safeguarding data. Active measures are taken to protect the data from misuse or harm. Such actions can be pre-emptive i.e. security steps taken before the data is collected or the actions could be reactive i.e. steps taken after the platform has been set up. DIGIT recommends pre-emptive steps as a best practice, and has[ data security](https://core.digit.org/focus-areas/data-security) measures embedded within its design.

#### What is data privacy?

Data privacy means keeping the data in the control of the individual and allowing the individual to decide what is to be done with their data. Data that is collected without consent of an individual, when exposed and combined with other data points can cause citizens to be identified and targeted. That’s why protecting data indirectly protects the citizen as well.

Data Privacy requires protecting the data from unwarranted viewing or use. This involves taking steps such as masking or encrypting data, restricting access to the data, collecting and storing data that serves a defined purpose. \<PROGRAM NAME> is designed to maintain the privacy of citizens and protect data by taking all the steps mentioned above and [more](https://core.digit.org/focus-areas/privacy).

#### What is personally identifiable information (PII)?

PII stands for personally identifiable information or is also interchangeably used as personal data. Personal data is basically any information that makes a person either identifiable. This consists of data that is unique for each person. When it is combined with other forms of data, it can help in identifying a person. For example, our biometric information, credit card details, passport details etc. are all PII.
