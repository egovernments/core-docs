# Code Structure

The code is organised in the following code repo:

Refer to the folder structure below:

The dags folder is the folder which contains the DAG code.

The queries folder contains the ES queries for the individual modules

For adding a new module we need to add a module-specific file in the queries folder with the transform logic and then refer to the DAG code in both manual and trigger versions.
