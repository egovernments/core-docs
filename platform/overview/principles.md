description: The foundational approach and design principles of the DIGIT platform
---

# Principles

1. Security and Privacy - DIGIT is designed to be secure by default, with configurable role based access. All PII is encrypted and no PII is emitted into analytical systems.&#x20;
2. Single Source of Truth - Shared Data Registries ensures data is kept up to date and reused without creating multiple copies of transactional data.
3. Built for Scale - Multi-tenancy and Microservices architecture enables rolling out of services built on DIGIT to large number of citizens in multiple cities and provinces on a shared infrastructure.&#x20;
4. Flexible - DIGIT is designed to enable each tenant to configure their own master data, workflows and if required their build and deploy their own version of the service even on a shared infrastructure.&#x20;
5. &#x20;Modular - All DIGIT components are modular microservices with well defined APIs. All services can be scaled, evolved and deployed independent of each other.&#x20;
6. Interoperable - API first design and uses of Open Standards wherever possible ensure DIGIT is interoperable with other systems.&#x20;
7. Ease of Use - DIGIT is designed keep in mind ease of access of all actors - citizens, employees, administrators as well as developers, system administrator etc.
8. Open - DIGIT is open source, uses all open source technologies and standards.
