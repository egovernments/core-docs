# Sandbox

If you want to quickly develop a DIGIT service, you will need to access the Sandbox environment where we have already set up DIGIT Core Services. To access the DIGIT services you will need an API Key and Secret. We are working on a self-service portal where you can register and get the keys. In the meantime, you can send an email to partner@egov.org.in to get the API access keys.

Once you get the API access keys, follow the step-by-step[ Developer Guide](../guides/developer-guide/backend-developer-guide/) to build a new DIGIT service.
