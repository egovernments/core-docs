# Overview

**D**igital **I**nfrastructure for **G**overnance and **I**nclusive **T**ransformation (DIGIT) is an open-source, scalable, interoperable platform for responsive public service delivery and good governance.  It enables governments to digitize public service delivery with intuitive interfaces for citizens, front-line employees and administrators. DIGIT enables a seamless and unified exchange of information between citizens, employees & vendors, administrators and policymakers. DIGIT is an open-source platform built for scale. It enables the digital transformation of multiple government departments and is highly flexible enabling it to serve a variety of needs.&#x20;

## Motivation For Building Governance Platform

Government bodies deliver and manage a host of public services. Technology is the enabler in providing the infrastructure for seamless management and governance. The key challenge here is the several limitations (listed below) facing the effective adoption and implementation of technology, especially in low and middle-income countries.&#x20;

**Multiple Similar Systems -** In a federated government structure, multiple agencies operate at national, regional, and local levels, each implementing its custom-built systems. The system architecture is often hard-wired to support specific requirements of individual ministries, departments and agencies for distinct sectors. These systems, though similar, cannot be reused in case the policies change in future.

_DIGIT as a technology platform deals with federation within governance at national, regional and local levels. It also serves the individual ministries, departments and agencies within a sector. Therefore a federated approach to architecture is baked into the design of the platform to address the realities of how governments work._

**Scalability Issues** - Most of these applications are not scalable in terms of meeting the evolving demands of a growing population or achieving streamlined governance objectives. The scope of localised systems is limited to specific goals that often include data collection or coordination between stakeholders. This restricts the scope for promoting ease of service delivery.&#x20;

_DIGIT is a scalable platform that addresses the requirements of populous countries as well as smaller countries effectively. DIGIT drives improvements in governance and public service delivery initiatives._

</div>

**Data Fragmentation** - The existing systems cannot exchange data with other applications. Data is locked in siloed applications. Administrators find it difficult to get a unified view of the data to monitor performance and identify areas of improvement.

_The foundations of effective governance and robust policy-making are built on high-quality data and coordination across multiple agencies and ministries. DIGIT enables this through data registries that enable a shared source of truth and robust interoperability across institutional and systemic boundaries._

**Vendor Lock-In -** Proprietary systems do not support scalable solutions that evolve with changing requirements.

_Countries must have the ability to control and manage their data and systems as per their national priorities. DIGIT enables this as it is open source, free to use and is backed by a wide ecosystem of vendors enabling governments to switch service providers without losing strategic control._

Multiple other challenges like security concerns and limited technical capabilities hinder the government's ability to effectively utilise technology for large-scale public service delivery.

Well-designed technology ensures public service delivery is inclusive and accessible to all citizens. The DIGIT platform contains a set of reusable building blocks built using robust design principles that can accelerate the digital transformation of public service delivery systems.

## Key Platform Design Principles

The DIGIT platform design is based on the following key principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Shared data registries ensure data is updated and reused without duplication of transactional data. DIGIT registries offer standard API access that can be leveraged by multiple service providers.
2. **Security and Privacy** - DIGIT is designed to be secure by default featuring configurable role-based access. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is encrypted and is not accessible by analytical systems.&#x20;
3. **Scalability -** DIGIT is built for scale. Its event-driven asynchronous microservices architecture enables DIGIT to handle millions of service requests with ease.
4. **Flexible** - DIGIT adopts a multi-user approach. Users (agencies or service providers) have the provision to configure their master data and workflows. They also have the flexibility to develop and implement custom service versions.
5. &#x20;**Modular** - DIGIT components are designed as modular microservices with interoperable APIs. Each service can be scaled, updated and deployed autonomously independent of others.&#x20;
6. **Interoperable** - API first design and use of Open Standards wherever possible ensures DIGIT is interoperable with other systems. Data can be exchanged seamlessly as and when required.
7. **Ease of Access** - DIGIT enables easy access to all stakeholders including citizens, employees, administrators, developers or system administrators. Data available through API can be routed to specific applications on the web, mobile, or chat.
8. **Open** - DIGIT is open source and uses open source technologies and standards to ensure that data and core services are never vendor locked-in. MIT License gives the right to any agency or its partners to copy the source code and deploy it for their needs.

## Typical Public Service Design

A typical public service delivery starts with a citizen applying for a service or a service connection. The diagram below abstracts the typical information exchange flow required to enable the delivery of a service.

A digital system offers the following capabilities to improve citizen experience:

1. Register/Login - Citizens can register, sign in, or authenticate themselves. Single sign-on capability streamlines access to digital services.&#x20;
2. Apply/Upload - Citizens can request services by completing an application form and uploading necessary documents. Services should be accessible through multiple channels and in various languages.&#x20;
3. Pay/Bill - Citizens can make payments for services and download bills. Multiple payment options, including digital and cash, should be available..&#x20;
4. Inform/Track - Citizens can track service progress or receive updates via SMS, email, or app notifications.
5. Support/Feedback - Citizens can raise support requests or provide feedback on service closure. The system should allow configuring surveys and feedback forms, with the ability to analyse responses for corrective action.

The following capabilities support the employee and management experience:

1. Assign - Employees or vendors can assign service applications or trigger workflows tailored to different user/agency local requirements.
2. Search/View - Employees or vendors can search for and view applications based on multiple attributes.
3. Update/Comment - Employees can update and comment on service applications, facilitating structured and unstructured data exchange between parties.
4. Deliver/Verify- Employees or vendors can deliver services, such as setting up a new connection, or verify and certify information provided by citizens. Offline-capable apps are crucial in low mobile coverage areas, with data synchronization capabilities to handle load spikes.&#x20;
5. Monitor/Improve - Administrators can monitor service performance and identify areas for improvement. All transactions should generate data events in an analytical database for comprehensive performance monitoring.
6. Plan/Budget - Administrators and policymakers can plan and budget for service improvement, linking expenditures to outcomes.

## DIGIT Service Architecture

DIGIT offers a set of [building blocks](platform/core-services/) (i.e. services) that can leveraged to develop any [digital services ](./#typical-public-service)while adhering to the [key design principles](./#key-principles). Additionally, DIGIT provides optional accelerators like DIGIT UI and Dashboard Framework that can be extended to create citizen, employee and administrator dashboards.&#x20;

The diagram below illustrates how some of the reusable building blocks interact to realize a typical public service delivery. Leveraging reusable building blocks not only speeds up delivery but also ensures well-structured digital services. The interactions between these services are detailed in the [Service Architecture](platform/architecture/service-architecture.md).&#x20;

![DIGIT Services](<.gitbook/assets/image (270).png>)

All services are built on DIGIT emits micro-level transactional data into an analytical database. This is key for real-time monitoring and auditing of the operations. It facilitates planning, budgeting and policy decision-making.&#x20;

DIGIT is proven and well-supported serving over 1000 cities. Ecosystem partners including System Integrators are using DIGIT to build and deliver services.  DIGIT Core LTS 2.9 version comes with long-term support. This implies that any technical issues like security or performance reported on any of these services in the DIGIT Core 2.9 LTS version will be fixed by the DIGIT team.&#x20;

DIGIT is easy to install, configure and use. To install DIGIT on your servers use the [DIGIT Installation Guide](get-started/installation-guide/). To design and develop a new service on the DIGIT Platform go through the [DIGIT Design Guide](get-started/design-guide/) and [DIGIT Developer Guide](get-started/developer-guide/).  You can also take up the DIGIT Certification through the [DIGIT Academy](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MEQmzNGXk5ajuZujG7E/s/kI0HGCGboIe1ltcfV9XD/). &#x20;
