# 4.Ingress,WAF

### Ingress:

Ingress **exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster**. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource. An Ingress may be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting.

An Ingress may be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting. An [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers) is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a load balancer, though it may also configure your edge router or additional frontends to help handle the traffic.

### WAF:

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

### SSL termination:

SSL termination is a process by which SSL-encrypted data traffic is decrypted (or offloaded). Servers with a secure socket layer (SSL) connection can simultaneously handle many connections or sessions. An SSL connection sends encrypted data between an end-userâ€™s computer and web server by using a certificate for authentication. SSL termination helps speed the decryption process and reduces the processing burden on backend servers.
