# Development Pre-requisites

## Checklists

Before beginning development on top of DIGIT make sure:&#x20;

* [x] DIGIT code from DIGIT-OSS, egov-mdms-data, configs etc.. has been forked from GitHub under your organizationâ€™s umbrella account.&#x20;
* [x] You have access to the forked repositories from your GitHub user account. Note that the user account is different from the organization's account.&#x20;
* [x] Access to a DIGIT environment - FQDN, Access keys etc..The DIGIT environment can be a single VM setup for a development environment. Please refer to these docs for the installation of DIGIT.&#x20;
* [x] Install DIGIT in a development environment (Single VM setup) by following the [quick setup guide](https://core.digit.org/guides/installation-guide/quick-setup).&#x20;

We recommend pointing the following services to the dev environment -&#x20;

* [User](../../../../platform/core-services/user-services.md)
* [MDMS](../../../../platform/core-services/mdms-master-data-management-service/)
* [Localization](../../../../platform/core-services/location-services.md)
* [Id-Gen](../../../../platform/core-services/id-generation-service.md)
* [URL-shortener](../../../../platform/core-services/url-shortening-service.md)
* [Workflow](../../../../platform/core-services/workflow-service/)

Some of the above services can also be port forwarded using Kubernetes to bypass user auth.

The following DIGIT services should be running locally:

* [Persister](../../../../platform/core-services/persister-service/)
* [Indexer ](../../../../platform/core-services/indexer-service/)(optional)
* [PDF Service](../../../../platform/core-services/pdf-generation-service.md)

<!---->

* [x] CD/CI has been set up for DIGIT. This is a pre-requisite to deploying new DIGIT modules. CD/CI processes will be used to build and deploy the new module that will be developed.&#x20;
* [x] [Design phase artefacts](design-inputs/)
* [x] In addition, knowledge of the following technologies is required for developing on DIGIT:

<!---->

* Java/J2EE
* Spring Boot
* REST APIs and related concepts like path parameters, headers, JSON etc.
* Git
* PostgreSQL
* Kafka
