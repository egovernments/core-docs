# Troubleshooting common issues and error handling.

* **Dependency Conflicts**: Check for conflicting versions of dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file and resolve them by specifying compatible versions.
* **Missing or Incorrect Imports**: Verify that all necessary packages are imported correctly. Check for typos or missing package names.
* **Widget Rendering Issues**: Debug issues related to widget rendering by checking the widget tree, examining layout constraints, or identifying invalid or conflicting widget properties.

### Debugging Techniques

* **Logging**: Use print statements or logging libraries like `logger` or `flutter_logger` to log important information during development.&#x20;
* **Debugging Tools**: Utilize Flutter's debugging tools such as the Flutter DevTools, which provide insights into the app's performance, UI layout, and network requests. Use breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code for closer inspection.

### Error Handling Strategies

* **Try-Catch Statements**: Surround code that may throw exceptions with a try-catch block to handle anticipated errors gracefully. Use the catch block to provide appropriate error messages or perform recovery actions.
* **Null Safety**: Embrace Flutter's null safety feature to catch and handle null-related errors at compile time. Use the `?` and `!` operators to handle nullable variables and avoid null-related runtime errors.
