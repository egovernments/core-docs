At the core of Flutter's architecture is the Flutter engine, which is written in C++ and provides low-level rendering capabilities. The engine interfaces with the host operating system and handles tasks such as layout, drawing, and gesture recognition.

On top of the engine, Flutter provides a comprehensive UI toolkit that consists of widgets.&#x20;



Widgets are the building blocks of Flutter applications and represent different elements of the user interface.&#x20;

Flutter's reactive framework allows widgets to rebuild efficiently when there are changes
