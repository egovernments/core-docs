### Standardise Design Principles <a href="#ads3u4tuhemc" id="ads3u4tuhemc"></a>

Standardising design principles ensures consistency across the UI library, reducing the likelihood of UI/UX audit bugs. This involves establishing design guidelines, naming conventions, and component usage patterns.

### Enhance Stability  <a href="#axrg4lhtt9hj" id="axrg4lhtt9hj"></a>

Enhancing the stability of the UI library is crucial for reducing UI/UX audit bugs. This includes optimizing code quality, implementing robust testing strategies, and monitoring performance to identify and address potential issues.

### Convert px To em Units <a href="#tfi9ikybdhq4" id="tfi9ikybdhq4"></a>

Transitioning from px to em units improves scalability and accessibility, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to inconsistent text sizes and layouts across different devices and screen resolutions.

### Integrate With Storybook <a href="#mg554ko71sbr" id="mg554ko71sbr"></a>

Storybook provides a development environment for testing and documenting components, helping to identify and address UI/UX audit bugs early in the development process.

### Implement Color & Text Size Constants <a href="#n19lwfyl25ke" id="n19lwfyl25ke"></a>

Implementing colour and text size constants ensures consistency in styling across the UI library, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to colour contrast, readability, and visual hierarchy.

### Add New Component Variants <a href="#id-20groophu08q" id="id-20groophu08q"></a>

Introducing newer component variants enhances flexibility and caters to diverse user requirements, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to limited functionality or options.

### Create Flutter Widgets <a href="#naxi948y7b02" id="naxi948y7b02"></a>

Creating Flutter widgets extends the UI library's reach to mobile platforms, reducing UI/UX audit bugs related to inconsistent user experiences across different devices and operating systems.
