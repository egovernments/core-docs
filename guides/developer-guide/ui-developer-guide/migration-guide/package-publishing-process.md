# Package Publishing Process

## Version Updates

Once all changes were completed, the packages were assigned new versions and published. Below is a list of updated versions:

| Package Name                            | Version       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| @egovernments/digit-ui-libraries        | 2.0.0-rc19-04 |
| @egovernments/digit-ui-components       | 2.0.0-rc19-04 |
| @egovernments/digit-ui-react-components | 2.0.0-rc19-04 |
| @egovernments/digit-ui-svg-components   | 2.0.0-rc19-04 |

## Github actions workflow

Since there were modifications in the build process, the GitHub Actions workflow was updated accordingly. Below is the modified GitHub Actions file handling the package publishing process:

```
