# 1. Pre-requisites

#### Topics covered:

* [Brief intro to AWS services](1.-pre-requisites.md#overview)
* [Pre-reads for deployment](1.-pre-requisites.md#pre-reads)
* [Pre-requisites to check before deployment](1.-pre-requisites.md#prerequisites)

## Overview

The [**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html) is one of the AWS services for deploying, managing and scaling any distributed and containerized workloads. Here we can provision the EKS cluster on AWS from the ground up using [**terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) **(**infra-as-code) and then deploy the DIGIT platform services as config-as-code using [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/).

* Know about EKS: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsUnPWp5ilc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsUnPWp5ilc)​
* Know what is terraform: [https://youtu.be/h970ZBgKINg](https://youtu.be/h970ZBgKINg)​

## Pre-requisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

1.  ​[**AWS account**](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h\_ct\&src=default\&redirect\_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) with admin access to provision EKS Service. You can always subscribe to a free AWS account to learn the basics and try, but there is a limit to [**what is offered as free**](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)**.** For this demo, you need a commercial subscription to the [EKS service](https://docs.digit.org/urban/platform/setup-digit/install-on-cloud/on-aws/2.-understanding-eks). If you want to try for a day or two, it might cost you about Rs 500 - 1000.

    <mark style="color:red;">**Note**</mark><mark style="color:red;">: Post the Demo (for eGov internal folks only) - request for the AWS access for 4 hrs. Time-bound access to eGov's training AWS account is available upon request and the available number of slots per day).</mark>
2. Install [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) (any version) on the local machine - it helps in interaction with the Kubernetes cluster.
3. Install [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - this helps package the services along with the configurations, environments, secrets, etc into [**Kubernetes manifests**](https://devspace.cloud/docs/cli/deployment/kubernetes-manifests/what-are-manifests)**.**
4. Install [tfswitch](https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher) to run different versions of terraform on the machine. [tfswitch](https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher) supports multiple terraform versions on the same machine and you can toggle between the desired versions.

```
// On Mac
brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch
```

```
// On Linux
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher/release/install.sh | bash
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Please refer to tfswitch documentation for different platforms. Terraform version 0.14.10 can be installed directly as well.
{% endhint %}

5\. Run tfswitch and it will show a list of terraform versions. Scroll down and select [**terraform**](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.10/) version (0.14.10) for the [Infra-as-code](../sdc/2.-infra-as-code-kubespray.md) (IaC) to provision cloud resources as code. This provides the desired resource graph and also helps destroy the cluster in one go.​
